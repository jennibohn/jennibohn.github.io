  "about_title":"About Me",
  "about_text":"I was born in 1995, married, and graduated in physiotherapy from the Pontifical Catholic University of Paran√° (PUCPR) in 2017. I started my career in physiotherapy working in hospitals and simultaneously teaching Pilates classes. I have always loved working with gerontological physiotherapy, so I focused on studying this particular population. I have courses in physiology in aging and gerontology physiotherapy. After a few years working as an integrative physiotherapist, I felt the need to further specialize to improve my treatment, so I completed a postgraduate degree in Acupuncture and I am currently pursuing one in Urogynecology Physiotherapy. I provide home care services through home care companies and private clients; I also provide treatments at a Physiotherapy Clinic, where I treat a wide range of pathologies. My main focus is not only on rehabilitation but also on prevention and improving the quality of life. Want to learn more about how physiotherapy can help you have a better quality of life?
